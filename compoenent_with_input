component inerter
% Translational Inerter
% The block represents an ideal mechanical translational inerter. Force is
% proportional to the rate of change of the relative velocity across the
% ports.
%
% Connections R and C are mechanical translational conserving ports, 
% with R representing the inerter rod, while C is associated with the
% inerter case. The block positive direction is from port R to port C.
